                "A sunken ship"
            ],
            "explanation": "This riddle uses metaphor to describe an island as a 'silent giant' sleeping in the sea, holding treasures (natural resources, beauty) that it cannot keep because they can be explored or taken by others. It's a good riddle because it prompts thinking about natural formations in a poetic way. 'A sunken ship' could also fit as it rests in the sea holding treasures."

            "explanation": "Fire consumes fuel to continue burning ('always hungry') and needs to be fed. Touching fire can burn skin, turning it red. The riddle personifies fire, making it engaging. No other common answers fit as well."

                "A lock"
            ],
            "explanation": "Turning a key locks or unlocks a door, controlling access. The riddle cleverly describes the function of a key without naming it. 'A lock' is also acceptable as it turns to open or secure something."

            "possible_other_answers": [],
            "explanation": "A map depicts cities, forests, and bodies of water but doesn't contain the physical entities. This riddle is effective because it plays on representations versus reality."

            "explanation": "Clouds move in the sky ('fly without wings') and can produce rain ('cry without eyes'). They often block sunlight, bringing shade or darkness. The riddle uses poetic imagery, making it thought-provoking. 'Raincloud' is a specific type of cloud that fits."

            ],
            "explanation": "A comb has 'teeth' used for grooming hair but doesn't bite. The riddle is good because it uses a common metaphor. 'A zipper' also has 'teeth' that interlock but doesn't bite."

            "possible_other_answers": [],
            "explanation": "'Seven' is an odd number. Removing the 'S' leaves 'even.' The riddle is clever because it involves wordplay with numbers."

            ],
            "explanation": "Banks have 'branches' (locations) but none of the tree parts. The riddle uses homonyms to mislead. 'A river' also has branches (tributaries)."

          "answer": "A keyboard",
          "possible_other_answers": [],
          "explanation": "This riddle plays on the multiple meanings of words. A keyboard has 'keys' but doesn't unlock anything. It has 'space' (the spacebar) but no physical room, and you can 'enter' (the enter key) but can't go outside. It's a good riddle because it challenges the listener to think abstractly about common objects."

          "answer": "An echo",
          "possible_other_answers": ["Sound"],
          "explanation": "An echo reflects sound without a physical form ('nobody'). It 'speaks' and 'hears' as it replicates sounds. The reference to 'wind' adds a poetic touch, implying that sound travels through air. It's a good riddle because it uses personification to describe a natural phenomenon. 'Sound' could be another answer, but it doesn't fully fit all aspects."

          "possible_other_answers": ["Night"],
          "explanation": "Darkness naturally arrives in the evening and leaves in the morning without any action from us. It's a good riddle because it describes a daily occurrence in a mysterious way. 'Night' is a possible answer as it shares the same characteristics."

          "explanation": "A circus has a 'ring' where performances happen, 'roads' (the paths performers take) but no cars, and performances act as a 'language' without spoken words. It's a good riddle because it layers multiple metaphors. 'A track field' could fit as it has a ring (the track) and roads without cars."

          "possible_other_answers": ["A story"],
          "explanation": "A joke can be 'cracked' or 'made,' 'told,' and 'played' (as in a practical joke). It can evoke laughter or sometimes offend, bringing tears. It's a good riddle because it uses various contexts of a common concept. 'A story' is another possible answer as it can also fit these descriptions."

          "explanation": "Sand is used to build sandcastles, erodes mountains over time, can cause blindness (sand in eyes), and is used in making glass (helping others to see). The riddle is good because it connects disparate ideas through a common element. 'Time' could be another answer as it can metaphorically build and destroy."

          "possible_other_answers": [],
          "explanation": "A river 'runs,' has a 'mouth' (where it empties), a 'head' (source), and a 'bed' (riverbed). It's a classic riddle that personifies a natural element. The lack of other answers makes it a precise and well-crafted riddle."

          "possible_other_answers": [],
          "explanation": "Fire 'grows' when it spreads, needs air (oxygen) to sustain combustion, and is extinguished by water. The riddle is effective because it uses contradictions to describe the characteristics of fire."

          "explanation": "A map represents towns, forests, and oceans but lacks the physical entities. The riddle is good because it challenges the listener to think abstractly about representations versus reality."

          "possible_other_answers": ["Constellations"],
          "explanation": "Stars appear at night and are not visible during the day due to sunlight. It's a poetic riddle that captures the beauty of the night sky. 'Constellations' could also fit as they are patterns of stars."

          "possible_other_answers": ["Ice"],
          "explanation": "A snowflake 'flies' as it falls, 'lies' on the ground, and 'runs' as water when it melts. It's a good riddle because it uses different states of matter to describe the lifecycle of a snowflake. 'Ice' could be another answer but doesn't fit as neatly."

          "possible_other_answers": ["Lead in a pencil"],
          "explanation": "Graphite is mined and encased in wood (pencils). It's used universally for writing. The riddle is intricate, requiring careful thought. 'Lead in a pencil' is a common misnomer and acceptable."

          "possible_other_answers": ["Shadow"],
          "explanation": "A reflection appears in water without getting wet. It's a good riddle because it plays with perceptions. 'Shadow' is less fitting but could be considered."

          "riddle_text": "As I navigate the labyrinth, I muse: I can fill a room or just one heart. Others may have me, but I can't be shared. What am I?",

          "possible_other_answers": ["Silence"],
          "explanation": "Loneliness can fill spaces emotionally, and while others may also be lonely, it isn't something that can be shared to lessen it. The riddle is profound, touching on human emotions. 'Silence' could also be a possible answer."

          "possible_other_answers": [],
          "explanation": "The wind is invisible but can be felt, and its strength varies. It's a good riddle because it describes an omnipresent natural force in a vivid way."

          "possible_other_answers": [],
          "explanation": "Fire consumes fuel ('hungry'), needs to be fed to continue burning, and can 'bite' (burn) without teeth. The riddle personifies fire, making it engaging."

          "possible_other_answers": ["Air"],
          "explanation": "Water is often associated with the color blue, can make you feel buoyant ('lighter'), but can also be heavy. The riddle is good because it uses contrasting properties. 'Air' could fit but doesn't fully match."

          "explanation": "Thunder is loud without a voice, and after it, there's a quietness that's not silence. It can be 'stolen' in the sense that it captures attention but can't be physically held. 'Wind' could also fit but not as precisely."

          "possible_other_answers": [],
          "explanation": "Mountains have 'roots' underground, are taller than trees, and extend upwards but don't grow like living organisms. The riddle uses metaphor to describe geological features."

          "explanation": "The riddle describes an object found in a peaceful setting that doesn't physically move but can take you on journeys. A book fits this description as it can transport readers to different worlds through stories. 'No feet but leaves tracks' refers to the impact it leaves on the reader's mind.
